#Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid
#1 Bad Search
Search engines can be overly literal, not alloing for typos and approximations. Search engines shouldn't prioritise results based on number of query terms, rather on relevance to the search term.
#2 PDF Files for Online Reading
Don't rely on PDF files, they interrupt user flow, and make you squint. Reserve it for printing pages.
#3 Not changing the colour of Visited Links
Users will thank you for letting them know where they've already been. This creates and easy and simple way to assist navigation and save time.
#4 Non-Scannable Text
Make it beautiful. Don't be sloppy and write everything in one paragraph, break it up so the eye can easily absorb information at a glance.
#5 Fixed font size
Be careful to specify the font styles of different text types. The default size is small and hard to read. Don't be mean.
#6 Page Titles With Low earch Engine Visibility
SEO ranking is the bomb. Your users want to find you online, so make it easy for them to do so by ensuring key workds are accessible to the search engine by including it in tags, headings and in the first few words of your website content.
#7 Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement
Avoid designs that look like ads because users will ignore and not engage with it. Avoid Banners, Animations and pop-ups.
#8 Violating Design Conventions
Use consistent design aesthetic. Follow Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience: "users spend most of their time on other web sites." - that is, don't deviate from expectation, or they won't understand how to use your interface.
#9 Opening New Browser Windows
Don't open new browser windows. It's weird and annoying.
#10 Not Answering Users' Questions
Users will have things in mind that they're after, when designing your website think about what they want and make sure you provide it. For example, list prices of products and services, and describe them in sufficient detail to convince them of it's value!
