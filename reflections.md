###Reflections on Chapter 1
"Even and Engineer can Thrive on Emotional Intelligence"
If the chapter's title had read "lawyer" instead of "Engineer", it could have summarised the conversation I had with flatmates last night. I'm a strong believer that there's vital substance in sensitivity.
Something that bemuses me about books such as this one is their insistence to wrap important, universally applicable messages in a veneer of individualistic, self-promoting toolsets. There's somehow an irony to me in promoting empathy and sociability along with the ideology of self-improvement and "increased productivity and performance".
Nonetheless, I'm stoked to see read some interesting information on how emotional intelligence can be trained through mindfulness practices.
##The Critical Inner Voice
I definitely resonate with this - of course. I feel like the older I get, the more I get self-depricating in my thoughts. I can't help but wonder if the trend continues, until I become a grumpy old bum with no joy or optimism about the future. Oh no!
I like the suggestion that the narrator makes to overcome this challenge. I'll try to take it on. One example I could take which is true for me goes: "I don't have anything intelligent to contribute to social discussions", which would change to, "You don't have anything intelligent to contribute to social discussions", which I'd respond to with, "I DO have intelligent contributions to make to social discussions". I still need to think of ways that I might continue to regulate and move on from that inner critic...
##Lessons on privilege
I like how simple and compelling this Buzzfeed video is.It helps to clarify the blindness that I have towards my own privilege. To merely acknowledge my privilege as a white, middle-class male isn't enough, I need to understand the effect of my privilege, and further act to remediate in some ways... ideally in such a way that doesn't perpetuate a modern-day white man's burden, but actually working to invert inequalities. My intention is that I can use programming as a skill to help to achieve this.
